Hi there! It's a pleasure to meet you virtually. My name is Xinyu Zhou, and I am currently pursuing a [Master's degree in Biostatistics (Data Science Pathway)](https://ysph.yale.edu/school-of-public-health/graduate-programs/masters-in-public-health/biostatistics/master-data-science-methods-pathway/) at Yale University.

Before embarking on my graduate studies at Yale, I completed my undergraduate degree at [School of Public Health, Fudan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudan_University) in Shanghai, China with a major in Public Service Administration and a double major in Chinese Language and Literature. With collaborators around the world, I have been able to expand my research interests to include natural language processing, social media analysis, and global public health. I have published papers that have received around 200 citations and have also had the opportunity to peer-review more than 20 papers for top health informatics journals such as the [Journal of Medical Internet Research](https://www.jmir.org/).

In my spare time, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest developments in data science and exploring new tools and technologies in the field. I am currently working on improving the performance of few-shot and zero-shot learning and their application in medical data.
