Hi there! It's a pleasure to meet you virtually. My name is Xinyu Zhou, and I am currently pursuing a [Master's degree in Biostatistics (Data Science Pathway)](https://ysph.yale.edu/school-of-public-health/graduate-programs/masters-in-public-health/biostatistics/master-data-science-methods-pathway/) at Yale University. Growing up in Guangzhou, a vibrant and dynamic metropolis in China, allowed me to experience a diverse and fast-paced environment that shaped my love for exploration and discovery. Such a diverse and fast-paced environment sparked my love for travel and meeting new people from different cultures and backgrounds.

Before embarking on my graduate studies at Yale, I completed my undergraduate degree at [Fudan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudan_University) in Shanghai, China, where I gained a strong foundation in public health, data science, and statistical analysis. As a graduate student, I have been able to expand my research interests to include social media analysis, health data science, and global public health. I have published papers that have received around 200 citations and have also had the opportunity to peer-review more than 20 papers for top health informatics journals such as the [Journal of Medical Internet Research](https://www.jmir.org/) and [JMIR Public Health and Surveillance](https://publichealth.jmir.org/).

In my spare time, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest developments in data science and exploring new tools and technologies in the field. I am passionate about using data-driven approaches to address real-world problems and make a positive impact on society. If you're interested in learning more about my research, please feel free to check out my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lP_Xz1UAAAAJ). I am always open to new collaborations and opportunities to make a difference through data science.

In addition to my studies and research, I am also a big fan of literature, movies, drama, and TV series. I enjoy immersing myself in different worlds and experiencing diverse stories and perspectives through these mediums. I have particularly been fascinated by modern and contemporary Chinese literature, with its rich and diverse themes and styles. Some of my favorite authors include Zhang Chengzhi, Mo Yan, and Zhang Ailing, whose works have greatly influenced my understanding of Chinese culture and society. I especially enjoy exploring the complexities and contradictions of modern China through the eyes of these writers, who offer unique and poignant perspectives on the country's past and present. In my free time, I enjoy reading and discussing literature and movies with friends and colleagues, and I am always looking for new and exciting works to add to my reading & watching list.
